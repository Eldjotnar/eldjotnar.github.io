					<h1 style="margin:0">UMBRI - Exploring Video Game Design</h1>
					<h3>23.10.2015</h3>
					<p>When I was in high school, some friends and I developed a simple snake-like game that we could play on our TI calculators after (read: during) class. Several years later, I thought back to this game and thought I could modernize and bring it to the web. I've had no previous experience in video game design and hadn't even used JavaScript before, so I'm quite pleased with how the final product turned out. At some point in the future, I would like to release a mobile version of the game, but I need to think about the UI for a bit first.</p>
					<p>The game itself if quite simple. Like Snake, you move around attempting to eat 'food.' Once you've eaten it, it drops a shell as an additional obstacle (in addition to the walls). On hard mode, for every food you eat, the player speed increases gradually. There is also an AI that will chase you an eat you if you are too slow. </p>
