        <h2>bibulous</h2>
        <p>bibulous is an app that helps home bartenders find cocktails they can make with the bottles they already own.</p>
        <p>A greek word, meaning "to enjoy consuming alcohol", bibulous helps you do just that! Our extensive cocktail database
          includes everything from simple Gin and Tonics, to cocktails with obscure liquors that might otherwise go unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p>Purchase the app for $2.99 on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bibulous/id1441923349">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bibulous">Google Play Store</a> now!</p>

        <h2>gnomi</h2>
        <p>
          gnomi is a news aggregator app for independent readers who are frustrated with the polarization
          in the media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other news apps, gnomi uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human graders to analyze, review and grade news articles based on the respective level of bias. gnomi's proprietary grading method, called SlantID, ranges from L5-R5 (with L1/R1 being the least biased). 
          By revealing an article’s “slant,” users can educate themselves on both sides of every story. The tap-to-flip features allows users to read an article from one side and easily flip to an article on the same topic, but from the other side.          
        </p>
        <p>Check it out for free on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gnomi/id1396264496">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gnomi&hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>!</p>

        <h2>Peckish</h2>
        <p>Peckish is an app for finding recipes that use ingredients already in your pantry.</p>
        <p>
          I developed this app with a team of 3 other developers in January of 2018 for a class project.
          It was capable of searching for recipes that consisted primarily of things you already had on hand,
          generating a grocery list for things you needed, scanning product bar codes to automatically extract nutrional
          information, and storing notes about the recipes you did make. We didn't release it since the recipes
          in the database were collected from a web scraper and we couldn't be sure that we had legal use.
        </p>

        although I occasionally prefer WebAPI.
        In my free time, I enjoy swing dancing and making craft cocktails.</p>
